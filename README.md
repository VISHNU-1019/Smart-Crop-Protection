# 🚜 Smart Crop Protection System 🦊🚨  

## 🌱 Project Overview  
The **Smart Crop Protection System** is a **camera-based monitoring solution** designed to **protect farmlands from animals** that may damage crops. It uses a **live webcam feed** to detect potential threats and **activates a buzzing alarm** when an animal is detected. Farmers can **monitor their fields in real-time** and **stop the alarm manually** when necessary.  

This system serves as an **early warning mechanism** to help farmers safeguard their crops, reducing losses caused by animal intrusions. In future versions, **AI-based animal detection** and **automated deterrent systems** can be integrated for even better protection.
